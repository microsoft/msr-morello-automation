# dhclient will EXPIRE leases before attempting to renew them if there is a
# sufficiently large jump in wall time (one that steps over the rebinding
# window entirely).  While that makes some amount of sense (though it'd be
# nicer to have a state machine that prohibited a direct transition) and is in
# general probably a very rare thing, it happens not infrequently on our
# Morello boards, whose RTCs do not always keep time and sometimes get reset
# back to 2000.  The resulting multi-decade NTP timestep means that the next
# time dhclient wakes up, it tears down the network before trying again.  Even
# that might be acceptable, in general, except that we're NFS-rooted, and so
# losing the network is an irrecoverable catastrophe.  So, just don't do
# anything on EXPIRE events; a little antisocial in the worst case, but nothing
# our DHCP server can't deal with.
